# grid

A library for working with 2D rectangular arrays of data.

## Usage

Inspired by Advent of Code.
I found that I was often dealing with two dimensional grids of data,
and writing a load of ad-hoc functions for dealing with them.
So I decided to write a library around a map-like type,
that takes pairs of coordinates as keys,
but stores the data internally in a flat vector.
